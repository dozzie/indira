version 1.0.1

  * Fixed message length problem in control sockets (TCP and AF_UNIX) for
    cases when a request or a reply would be longer than kernel buffer.
  * Minor clarification in docs.

version 1.0.0

  * Added "indira_stdio" module for reading from STDIN with proper
    backpressure.
  * Added "workdir" option to indira_setup() function. It was already
    supported if set with application:set_env().
  * Added format_error() functions to convert errors returned by Indira to
    printable messages.
  * Added a helper for reloading configuration of daemonized application.
  * Added helpers for checking if an application is started.
  * Added an option to set permissions and ownership on a unix socket.
  * Added a watcher process that unlinks stale unix sockets on Erlang VM
    crash.
  * Unix sockets port driver replaced with code from one of my other projects.
  * Shortened typical float representation in JSON serializer.
  * Changed build system to erlang.mk.

  Backward incompatible changes:

  * Functions from public API moved to different modules (from indira_cli to
    gen_indira_cli module, from indira_app to indira module).
  * Old set_env() function replaced a better way of configuring applications
    that is easier to use for reloading config.
  * Module for working with AF_UNIX sockets (indira_af_unix) is no longer
    a public interface.
  * Errors from parse_arguments() and format_request() gen_indira_cli
    callbacks are now returned verbatim instead of wrapped in tagged tuple.

version 0.9.0

  * Initial public release.
