Helper application for running Erlang programs as unix daemons.

Indira provides management protocol through TCP/SSL/UNIX/... sockets,
which helps in following (somewhat tedious) tasks:

<ul>
  <li>check if the daemon finished its starting procedure</li>
  <li>order the daemon to shut down</li>
  <li>order the daemon to reload configuration (but how to reload, its up to
      daemon's author)</li>
  <li>retrieve metrics/status info from daemon</li>
  <li>other management commands</li>
</ul>

Note that Indira <b>is not</b> a module for loading data. It may be highly
inefficient. For management interface it shouldn't matter, though:
commands are typically a low-bandwidth traffic.

The application is named after Indira Toledo, a character of an excellent S-F
novel titled <i>Mother of Demons</i> by Eric Flint.

== Usage ==

=== Basic usage ===

Main idea behind using Indira is to have all the daemon's code written as
Erlang application: spawning processes in supervision tree, specifying
dependencies like `ssl' or `ssh' or `inets' applications, reading
configuration with {@link application:get_env/2} and so on. Daemonized
application doesn't need to (and probably shouldn't) know about Indira at all.
It also shouldn't attempt to interact with operating system about
daemonization, like reading command line arguments, configuration files or
writing PID files.

Indira shows up in {@link examples_escript. command line script} (run by
`escript'), which is used to preconfigure application's environment, start
required applications and do other tasks required to run a daemon. Indira only
relies on {@link application} interface and on parameters provided by command
line script.

=== Command subsystem ===

There is an additional, optional -- although highly recommended -- subsystem
of issuing commands to the daemonized application. From the application it
requires a {@link examples_command_executor. command executor} process, which
receives messages of specific structure and replies to them with other
messages (see {@link indira} module for protocol details). Still, an
application doesn't need to know about Indira.

In fact, the application doesn't even need to include command executor. It
could be written separately, as long as it knows how to talk to the
application.

Indira on its part will start several so called
{@link gen_indira_listener. listeners}, which receive commands from user. The
commands will be passed to command executor and replies will be passed back to
the user. List of listeners to start is specified in application
configuration (see {@link examples_app_config} for some examples).

== Supervision tree ==

The supervision tree looks as follows:

== Where to start reading documentation ==

Indira users typically want to study {@link indira} module as their main
interface (including protocol used to execute commands coming from listeners).

Programmers writing listener modules will additionally need to read
documentation of {@link gen_indira_listener} module, which also specifies
communication protocol between Indira and listeners.
